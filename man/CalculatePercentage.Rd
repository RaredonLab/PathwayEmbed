\title{Calculate the percentage of cells in activation status}
\usage{
CalculatePercentage(to.plot, group_var)
}
\arguments{
\item{to.plot}{A data frame containing at least a \code{scale} column and a grouping column.}

\item{group_var}{A string specifying the grouping variable (e.g., "genotype", "treatment").}
}
\value{
A data frame with the percentage of ON/OFF cells and Cohen's d (if applicable).
}
\description{
This function calculates the percentage of cells in ON (scale > 0) and OFF (scale < 0)
activation states within each group defined by \code{group_var}. If exactly two groups
are provided, it also computes Cohen's d effect size between their activation values.
